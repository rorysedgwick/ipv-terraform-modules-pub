## Pre-Commit Checking / Verification

There is a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration setup in this repo, this uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to verify your commit before actually commiting, it runs the following checks:

* Check Json files for formatting issues
* Fixes end of file issues (it will auto correct if it spots an issue - you will need to run the git commit again after it has fixed the issue)
* It automatically removes trailing whitespaces (again will need to run commit again after it detects and fixes the issue)
* Detects aws credentials or private keys accidentally added to the repo
* Reformat `.hcl` files (those using the `.tf` extension) into a consistent structure

### Dependency Installation
To use this locally you will first need to install the dependencies, this can be done in 2 ways:

#### Method 1 - Python pip

Run the following in a terminal:

```
sudo -H pip3 install checkov pre-commit cfn-lint
```

this should work across platforms.

#### Method 2 - Brew

If you have brew installed please run the following:

```
brew install pre-commit ;\
brew install cfn-lint ;\
brew install checkov
```

### Post Installation Configuration
Once installed run:
```
pre-commit install
```

To update the various versions of the pre-commit plugins, this can be done by running:

```
pre-commit autoupdate && pre-commit install
```

This will install / configure the pre-commit git hooks, if it detects an issue while committing it will produce an output like the following:

```
 git commit -a
check json...........................................(no files to check)Skipped
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
detect aws credentials...................................................Passed
